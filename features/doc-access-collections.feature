Feature: Access document collections
  In order to operate on objects related to a document
  As a developer using python-docx
  I need a way to access each of the document's collections


  Scenario: Access the inline shapes collection of a document
     Given a document having inline shapes
      Then document.inline_shapes is an InlineShapes object

     Given a document containing three paragraphs
      Then document.paragraphs is a list containing three paragraphs


  Scenario: Access the section collection of a document
     Given a document having sections
      Then document.sections is a Sections object
