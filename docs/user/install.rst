Installing
==========

.. note:: python-docx versions 0.3.0 and later are not API-compatible with
   prior versions.

|docx| is hosted on PyPI, so installation is relatively simple, and just
depends on what installation utilities you have installed.

|docx| may be installed with ``pip`` if you have it available::

    pip install python-docx

|docx| can also be installed using ``easy_install``, although this is
discouraged::

    easy_install python-docx

If neither ``pip`` nor ``easy_install`` is available, it can be installed
manually by downloading the distribution from PyPI, unpacking the tarball,
and running ``setup.py``::

    tar xvzf python-docx-{version}.tar.gz
    cd python-docx-{version}
    python setup.py install

|docx| depends on the ``lxml`` package. Both ``pip`` and ``easy_install``
will take care of satisfying those dependencies for you, but if you use this
last method you will need to install those yourself.


Dependencies
------------

* Python 2.7 or 3.4+
* lxml >= 2.3.2
