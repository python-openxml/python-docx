class lazyproperty(Generic[T]):
    """Decorator like @property, but evaluated only on first access.

    Like @property, this can only be used to decorate methods having only a `self`
    parameter, and is accessed like an attribute on an instance, i.e. trailing
    parentheses are not used. Unlike @property, the decorated method is only evaluated
    on first access; the resulting value is cached and that same value returned on
    second and later access without re-evaluation of the method.

    Like @property, this class produces a *data descriptor* object, which is stored in
    the __dict__ of the *class* under the name of the decorated method ('fget'
    nominally). The cached value is stored in the __dict__ of the *instance* under that
    same name.

    Because it is a data descriptor (as opposed to a *non-data descriptor*), its
    `__get__()` method is executed on each access of the decorated attribute; the
    __dict__ item of the same name is "shadowed" by the descriptor.

    While this may represent a performance improvement over a property, its greater
    benefit may be its other characteristics. One common use is to construct
    collaborator objects, removing that "real work" from the constructor, while still
    only executing once. It also de-couples client code from any sequencing
    considerations; if it's accessed from more than one location, it's assured it will
    be ready whenever needed.

    Loosely based on: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6849299/1902513.

    A lazyproperty is read-only. There is no counterpart to the optional "setter" (or
    deleter) behavior of an @property. This is critically important to maintaining its
    immutability and idempotence guarantees. Attempting to assign to a lazyproperty
    raises AttributeError unconditionally.

    The parameter names in the methods below correspond to this usage example::

        class Obj(object)

            @lazyproperty
            def fget(self):
                return 'some result'

        obj = Obj()

    Not suitable for wrapping a function (as opposed to a method) because it is not
